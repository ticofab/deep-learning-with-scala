# From Zero To Deep Learning With Scala

Building blocks to train your own binary classifier using Scala.

[`ModelSettings.scala`](ModelSettings.scala) contains the actual construction of the neural network (using [Deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org)), the necessary hyperparameters and a few other settings.

[`ModelEvaluator.scala`](ModelEvaluator.scala) contains logic to load images, train and evaluate the model.

The dataset to run your own experiments is avaiable [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-O17UhjdJjtKJ1iAMDBJhaYMiTmhIIAi?usp=sharing).

I gave a few talks about this project. Please have a look at the [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/FabioTiriticco/from-zero-to-deep-learning-with-scala-232229345) or to a [talk recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQJgE1p2SG0).
